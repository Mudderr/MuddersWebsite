          <h2> Pre Apocalypse </h2>
          <p>Jackson grew up in a toxic household in Dallas, Texas, 
            with his mother Abigail and his father Robert. His father 
            was an abusive alcoholic, and his mother, though kind-hearted, was 
            too submissive and fearful to stand up to her husband. This created a 
            volatile and unsafe environment for Jackson, who never quite fit in with the others in his 
            neighborhood.</p>

            <p>Shortly before the apocalypse began, a particularly violent 
                altercation erupted between Jackson's parents. His father, in a drunken rage, began 
                attacking his mother. Jackson, unable to watch his mother suffer any longer, intervened. 
                The situation quickly escalated, and in a moment of self-defense, Jackson struck his father with a blunt 
                object. The blow was fatal, and Robert died instantly.</p>

            <p>Panicked and overwhelmed with guilt, Jackson fled the scene. For 
                two days, he evaded the authorities, who eventually caught up with him. As 
                they were escorting him to the police car, the apocalypse began. A group of infected attacked                 the officers, creating chaos and giving Jackson an opportunity to escape. He took advantage
                of the distraction and fled, avoiding the repercussions of his actions due to the 
                sudden outbreak.</p>

                <h2>Start of apocalypse</h2>
        <p>When the zombie apocalypse hit, Jackson was just 17. 
            Early on, he found himself teaming up with two other survivors: Luke, 
            an older teen from his neighborhood, and Daniel, a young man with a sharp mind a
            nd a knack for strategic thinking. </p>

        <p>In the early days of the apocalypse, Jackson, Mark, and Daniel 
            were cornered by a horde of zombies. They made a desperate run for it, but Luke
             didnt make it, and Daniel was bitten on the arm. In a harrowing attempt to save
              him, Jackson had to cut off Daniels arm, hoping to stop the infection. 
              Daniel ended up bleeding out and dying.</p>


                <h2>Mid Apocalypse</h2>
      <p>Jackson's motorcycle became his lifeline in the apocalyptic wasteland. 
        It allowed him to cover vast distances quickly, outrun hordes of zombies, and 
        carry essential supplies. His trusty machine gun became his weapon of choice, providing 
        both protection and a means to clear paths through the undead. </p>
        
      <p>During a confrontation with another survivor over scarce resources, Jackson was
         engaged in a brutal one-on-one fight. The other survivor slashed his right eye, leaving
          him blind on that side. </p>

      <p>Despite his tough exterior, Jackson carries the emotional scars of 
        his past and the apocalypse. He copes by adopting a laid-back and somewhat silly demeanor, often
         masking his pain with humor. He drinks and smokes heavily, using these vices
          as a way to numb his emotional wounds and deal with the 
          harsh reality of his world</p>
