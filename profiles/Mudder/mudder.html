          <h2> Origin Story </h2>
          <p> C!Mudder was raised in a close-knit community, born to a
             caring family, and spent his days helping fellow villagers. 
             Tragedy struck when their village was attacked, and C!Mudder was 
             fatally wounded in the battle. His father, consumed by grief and rage, 
             avenged his son by slaughtering the enemy combatants. </p>

             <p>That evening, the villagers gathered to perform a ritual, 
                hoping to bring C!Mudder back to life. They used a Totem of Undying
                 and offered prayers to their deity, believed to be a god of life.
                  C!Mudder's father placed the totem at his son's wound, and the 
                  villagers prayed fervently. Suddenly, a bright yellow-green light 
                  overwhelmed everyone, and C!Mudder's body floated into the air, 
                  surrounded by smoke. He was successfully revived. </p>

            <p>However, their deity was not who they thought. The god, "the dark one", was actually the god of death. 
                The revival came at a terrible cost: C!Mudder was granted immortality, forever 
                locked in a pact with Reaper. This immortality was a curse; C!Mudder could not die 
                and was destined to live and see everyone he loved perish, an eternity of 
                witnessing loss and despair.</p>

            <p>Worse still, the god took control over C!Mudder, using him to wreak 
                havoc upon the very villagers who had brought him back. Under Reaper's 
                malevolent influence, C!Mudder became an instrument of chaos and destruction, 
                turning against his own people. The villagers, realizing their grave mistake too 
                late, were powerless to stop the devastation. 

                Bound to Reaper's will, C!Mudder's immortality became a relentless torment, 
                a reminder of the god's cruel deception. The villagers' chants now rang hollow, a 
                chilling echo of their folly, as Reaper watched with cold amusement. </p>

          <h2> Extra Notes </h2>

         <p>when he revived he went from age 13 to age 24 </p>
         <p>After the Havoc, thte god gave back control. He uses cMudder more for amusement than to control and also use it as a bridge to see the overworld.</p>
         <p>Revival cooldown depends on how grave the injuries are. His body needs time to heal </p>
         <p>He is really old and does age, but when he dies he goes back to age 24, because that is his prime </p>
